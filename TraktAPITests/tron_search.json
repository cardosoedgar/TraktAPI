As Sado’s lieges oppose Yeongjo’s decision by putting their own lives at risk, Yeongjo locks Sado in a wooden rice chest. Locked up without being given a single drop of water, Sado is also deprived from succeeding the throne, having his son take his place as an heir. On the 8th day inside the chest, Sado faces death. The movie follows the most tragic and iconic 8 days in the history of Joseon Dynasty disclosing what forced a father to kill his own son.",
